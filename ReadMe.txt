Welcome to the Big Data Applications project by Louis Tardy and Arnaud Pignerol. This project was done as part of our classes.

The notebooks were separated in several parts. To be able to run them without interruption, you would have to do it in the following order :
- Data Preparation
- Feature Engineering
- Models Training
- Predictions
- Shap

Additionnal information and explanations about these notebooks can be found on the html files generated using sphinx library. You will find them located in the docs/build/html folder. The main page is named index.html.

As for the MLFlow UI, you would have to open a terminal, go to the directory of your project and execute "mlflow ui". This will show you a local address where all the runs are saved.
